Functional Reactive Decentralized State Management for User Interfaces

The framework adopts Functional Reactive Programming: variables' assignments are relations therebetween continuously, similar to the behavior of a formula in Excel Spreadsheets.
This is the first solution that coordinates the behavior with no centralized manager, thus allowing to design independent components.

This aims to be an alternative to Redux, which forces you to manage traditional imperative paradigms.

This is better also that traditional Binding frameworks, because this framework does not have redundant evaluations.
