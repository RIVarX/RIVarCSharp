Functional Reactive Decentralized State Management for User Interfaces

Learn by example:

```C#
Variable Concentration, Amount, Volume

Concentration=Amount/Volume

```

This assigment means binding, whenever Amount or Volume is changed, Concentration is updated. 

Such statements can bind variables in either directions, on the same object, or across two different objects; as a result the variables and bindings might form *any* network.

Unlike other frameworks, the updates are predictable, with no redundant updates and happens therebetween the variables.

The set of variables aims to be a **consistent UI application state**: the variables contains the values that reflect the recent inputs and bindings which flow them.
